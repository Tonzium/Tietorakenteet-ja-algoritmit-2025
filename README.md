## Introduction

This repository contains solutions to exercises coded in Python and C++ using JupyterLab. The goal of these tasks is to practice implementing algorithms and logic based on pseudocode provided in the course textbook, transforming them into functional Python or C++ code.

The exercises are intended to be completed with minimal use of built-in or library functions, encouraging a deeper understanding of core programming constructs and algorithmic thinking.
