    "# Task 5\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver (STRIPS)**  \n",
    "STRIPS is a formal representation framework for defining planning problems, originally developed to manage a robot’s behavior within a controllable, physical environment. Its main focus is on the automated construction of plans; ordered sequences of actions that transform a system from an initial configuration into a specified goal state. [^STRIPS-in-AI]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components of STRIPS:**  \n",
    "    1. **States:** Represented as collections of logical propositions that describe the current situation.  \n",
    "    2. **Goals:** Expressed as a set of conditions that must hold true to consider the task successfully completed.  \n",
    "    3. **Actions:** In STRIPS, each action is defined by three key parts:  \n",
    "         - **Preconditions:** Statements that must be satisfied before the action can be applied.  \n",
    "         - **Add Effects:** Conditions that become true as a result of executing the action.  \n",
    "         - **Delete Effects:** Conditions that become false as a result of executing the action. [^STRIPS-in-AI] [^wiki]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Terms:**\n",
    "1. **Heuristics:** Techniques used to guide problem-solving by reducing the search space and improving efficiency. While heuristics do not guarantee optimal solutions, they often produce good or optimal results in practical timeframes. [^STRIPS-in-AI]\n",
    "2. **Symbols:** Abstract representations used to encode knowledge in a form that AI systems can process and reason about, enabling the modeling of relationships and states within the planning domain. [^STRIPS-in-AI]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Planning with STRIPS\n",
    "1. **Define the Initial State:** Where the system starts.\n",
    "2. **Set the Goal State:** What the system should achieve.\n",
    "3. **Develop Actions:** Defined by their preconditions and effects.\n",
    "4. **Search for Solutions:** Using a strategy like backward chaining from the goal state to the initial state, identifying actions that satisfy the goal conditions. [^STRIPS-in-AI]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "While STRIPS was revolutionary, it has limitations, primarily its assumption of a static world and the lack of support for actions with nondeterministic outcomes or concurrent actions. Newer models and languages have built upon and extended its original framework, the basic principles of STRIPS continue to influence the field of AI. [^STRIPS-in-AI]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Given task\n",
    "Use A* search to find logical operations that change the state and lead to the desired final outcome.\n",

    "\n",
    "   * Role: It manages the Open List in the A* algorithm.\n",

    "     order based on their priority (cost).\n",
    "       * Low Priority Value = High Importance: In pathfinding, a lower \"cost\" (f-score) is better. So, the item with the\n",

    "   * Key Methods:\n",
    "       * `Enqueue(value, priority)`: Inserts a state into the queue while keeping the list sorted by priority.\n",
    "       * `Dequeue()`: Removes and returns the item with the lowest priority value (the best candidate).\n",
